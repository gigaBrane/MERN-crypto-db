This MERN Crypto Dashboard is built solely for my portfolio. 

I built this project to display knowledge of front end and back end programming. 

Obviously as it is a MERN Dashboard it is built using Mongo DB, Express, Node.js, and React for the front end. 

Limitations of the Free API from CoinGecko are clear, the performance is very poor. I did what I could to make the List and Detail pages more performant, making the List load in a single call, and caching call results for 60 seconds. 

The page is not responsive, I might add that later, although I am probably just going to move on to a new project. 

This dashboard also has a simple news carousel fed by CoinTelegraph RSS, and Login features that power a very basic crypto portfolio.
